This is a display screen to show real time analytics of a given website.

This project is a fork of Edd Sowden's dashboard built for the Government Digital Service.

His project can be found [here](https://github.com/edds/display-screen).


Using City Analytics Dashboard in your city
---------------

Deploying the app
----------

See [Dashboard Setup Instructions](http://dfd-dashboard-setup.herokuapp.com/) for the easiest way to run it.



For developers - local setup
-----------

This is a fairly bog-standard sinatra app.  Clone the respository, bundle install.

Install foreman with `gem install foreman`.

For it to work locally, you'll need to generate some keys from the Google API Console (and turn on the Google Analytics API).  You can use @migurski's OAuth dance app to get those values: [OAuth Dance](http://oauth-dance.herokuapp.com/)

You also need the View ID from the Google Analytics account you're accessing (look in Admin > View Settings > View ID).

It's probably worth generating everything you need, then creating a .env file in the root of the project with the environment variables the server calls for:

.env:

```
    CLIENT_ID=XXX.apps.googleusercontent.com
    CLIENT_SECRET=XXX
    REFRESH_TOKEN=XXX
    GA_VIEW_ID=XXX
    GA_WEBSITE_URL=www.yoursite.com
```

Then, once you've added that file, you can simply run

```
    foreman start -e .env
```

and view the project at localhost:5000

Testing
-----------

This project uses [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) to run the tests.
Install node and npm to run the tests.

Install the dependencies with
```
npm install
```

To run the tests:
```
karma start
```
